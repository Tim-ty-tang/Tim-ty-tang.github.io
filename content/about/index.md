I am a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer with particular interest in zero-to-one products driven by analytics and machine learning. I have a background in maths, and I have industry experience in data science application in logistics, insurance, energy and engineering. I have also experience in consulting surrounding data science maturity and application. I have a passion for building products that help people, and I am always looking for ways to improve my craft.

Here are some topics I am especially interested in professionally:

- My bread and butter is end-to-end data science product development for zero-to-one products. I have experience in building products with a core data science and/or machine learning layer/component, from scoping to production and iteration.
- LLM evals, especially private evals.
- Classical machine learning for forecasting purposes, and how to apply it with explainability.
- Small, user level LLMs.
- Graph ML and integrating graph ML into user level products.

And here are some things I am working on/learning/tinkering right now:

- I love building out data tools for my interests, as of now the two interest I want to build out data tools and data stacks for: NBA sports analytics; and Magic the Gathering.
- I am looking to build out local first workflows related to the advancement of GenAI:
  - LLM assited reading as a Personal Knowledge Management System component.
  - Video pipelines using vidgen and musicgen etc.
  - Associated devops, llmops, local infrastructure, homelab and  more to suport the above workflows.

And here are just an assortment of hobbies I love to talk about:

- My adventure holiday of choice is scuba diving.
