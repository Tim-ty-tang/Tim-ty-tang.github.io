A pair of pieces by the Gumroad founder.

## [Utopia?](https://sahillavingia.com/work?s=09)

> For me, it was no longer about growth at all costs, but “freedom at all costs.”

The above quote is the most inspiring thing I have ever read.

I think the key for this is to forgo growth and maximize on sustainability. If a commercial can be ran like a open source project, and treating employees much closer to collaborators than staff, I feel it empowers people to either take much more stake in the project and/or allows them to "live". Making people to write more and better, since as collaborators this would be the direction one would take instead of meetings, allowing only hourly pay allow people to be flexible to their own lifestyle, and allowing votes on what to work on and what to ship, is kind of an utopia.

The future of work is to not work.

On Growth, Optimization adn Destruction.

> Growth is a drug.

I think this is a very important point. Growth is a drug. It is very easy to get addicted to numbers going up. But it is not the only metric that matters.

> Optimization is a drug.

Optimization is also a drug. It is very easy to get addicted to the optimization feedback loop. But it is not the only metric that matters.

> Destruction is a not a drug.

And so embracing destruction is the key to freedom. To destroy effectively is to truly understand the value of the product. To having Bodhi. Letting go. Enlightenment,.

On 49-49-2 and solo.

I should really get my ass together and finally read NNT cover to cover. I wonder how to truly break this equilibrium. Buyout? I just do not see why the 2n would ever want to reliquis.
